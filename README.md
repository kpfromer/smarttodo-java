I am planning on making a cool todo list site with handy features!

My plan is to make a site where you can enter a homework item with date parsing and send emails to you at a certain time.

**Note:**

Make sure you run project in IDE with active profile set to dev!

**Example:**

`-Dspring.profiles.active=dev`
